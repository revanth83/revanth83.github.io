#Healthcare consulting industry and its data analytics needs

Healthcare providers operate within highly specialised business processes from scheduling through to discharge. Rising costs, long revenue cycles, growing patient populations, and changing regulatory demands create very complex financial, clinical, and operational environments.
The industry’s shift from a “fee for service” reimbursement system to Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and Pay for Performance (P4P) has changed how healthcare organizations operate. Now they not only need access to accurate information about patient medical history and diagnoses to deliver the best medical care, but also need tools to report on the organization’s performance and quality metrics.

##Typical challenges faced by the Health care organizations and proposed solutions:

###Challenge 1:
Improvement in Quality of Care and Patient Care Management — Quick and accurate diagnosis can be a matter of life or death in some situations. In efforts to improve the safety and quality of patient care, reduce medical errors, and provide higher levels of transparency to comply with regulatory mandates, health care providers can use data analytics to:

###Solution 1:

* Visualise patient health history, treatments and prescriptions.
* Monitor a patient’s health and track treatments over a period of time.
* Show how electronic health records (EHR) improve quality of care.
* Perform analysis and report on clinical outcomes and EBM processes resource Planning and
Operations.

###Challenge 2:
Healthcare facilities experience fluctuating capacity. This can affect the availability of patient care as well as revenue opportunities. Underestimating demand for appointments and procedures can leave patients waiting, reducing satisfaction of care. Overestimating demand underutilizes clinical staff and increases costs. On the other hand, supply chain deficiencies of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals impact budgets and performance measurements. Data analytics helps medical resource planners and operational managers to:

###Solution 2:
* Align material replenishment with actual usage.
* Improve utilisation of facilities, testing rooms and equipment.
* Reduce staffing costs by matching staff schedules to patient census.
* Improve patient flow and efficiency of admissions and discharges.

###Challenge 3:
Finance, Billing and Regulations — rising operational costs and changing reimbursement methods, such as P4P, increase the urgency to improve revenue cycles. To optimize cost allocation, eliminate waste, and manage complex billing and regulatory requirements, healthcare financial and accounting professionals use Data analytics to:

###Solution 3:
* Create an organization-wide view of spending and cash flow.
* Track actual vs. budget by department, physician and procedure.
* Reduce the cost of medical supplies and physician preference items.
* Ensure timely reimbursements from patients and insurance agencies.
* Track clinical and operational metrics for performance-based funding.
* Comply with HIPAA by using HL7 standards for information exchange.
