Title: Processing the MTA turnstile data!

During the first week, I wrote Python code to analyze the publicly available MTA turnstile data.
I also wrote a proposal on the possible usage of this data for solving practical problems and made
an oral presentation on it at the end of the week.

 New York has one of the the busiest Subways in the world
