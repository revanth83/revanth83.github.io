[//]: <>  # I am a data scientist at Metis, an immersive 12 week data science program in New York city. Rather than focusing on a single type of problem, I have experience in and enjoy a wide range of machine learning and data mangling problems. Through five data projects, Metis teaches and reinforces concepts such as statistical inference, data acquisition, supervised and unsupervised learning, D3.js, SQL and NoSQL databases, and Hadoop MapReduce. Some of these include predicting cinema gross revenue, using natural language processing to classify blogs by political leaning etc.

### More Information
Prior to becoming a data scientist, I worked in biomedical research, management engineering and healthcare consulting industries with experience in developing computational algorithms and mobile applications. Received Bachelor’s degree in Civil engineering in 2005 from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee; Master’s degree in Computational science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006; PhD degree in Biomedical engineering from the University of Western Australia in 2015.
